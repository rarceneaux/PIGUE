# PIGUE Appication Overview

Pigue is a web application created to allow a Offensive coorinator the ability to add plays, players with a photo, and formations with a photo to their playbook.
Themed after the famous EA Sports Madden football video game, PIGUE was inspired by my days as QB1 at Hunters Lane High School where Coach Jerry Pigue was my head coach and offensive play caller.
